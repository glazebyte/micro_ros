# micro-ROS for PlatformIO
This is a micro-ROS library for bare metal projects based on platformIO.

The build process for ROS 2 and micro-ROS is based on custom meta-build system tools and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
PlatformIO will handle the full build process, including dependencies, compilation and linkage.
